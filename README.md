Well,it is not a great function drawing tool,it can only draw a function that contains "x*x*x...(10)" at mostï¼Œx**-1 at least
But i am still interested in developing it
There are many powerful function drawing tools,but isn't it happy to learn and develop,try to make it by ourselves
And there are 2 files,the one named "include1" is more powerful,the one named "FGUI" is older,but on the other hand it is stabler
